This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  If the database query fails, the application may crash or return an unexpected response.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle such errors, providing a more robust and reliable application.
